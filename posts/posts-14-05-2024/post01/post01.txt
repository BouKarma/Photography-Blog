Title: A special picture at the sunset

This is one of my first pictures taken a few days after I got my camera, a Canon M50 Mark II.

It wasn't a picture I took on a trip or anything like that; it was just my dad and me going for a walk on the beach where I took a couple of shots. But this picture is special to me because it was the first one I felt proud of after finishing editing it.

After the pictures I took that day, I've been enjoying photography more and more every day.
