Title: A boat in the river of Aveiro

I took this picture on a trip to Aveiro, Portugal. I went there with my family at Christmas and took the opportunity to snap some photos since I was just starting out as a photographer.

The trip was amazing, and the city is beautiful. However, when I look at some of the pictures I took, they are not how I would take or edit them nowadays.

Even though I donâ€™t like them that much, I still enjoy the memories they bring to me.
